# MiscRobloxExploits
Miscellaneous roblox exploits, some that I made and others that are made by other people and improved by me. 
<br/>
<br/>

### Teleport GUI
Set your own custom teleport points.<br/>
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbsparrow/MiscRobloxExploits/main/TeleportGUI.lua"))();`<br/><br/>
 

If you would prefer a version with keybinds but no GUI, use this loadstring: <br/>`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbsparrow/MiscRobloxExploits/main/Legacy/TeleportCustom.lua"))();`<br/><br/>
Use `y` to set teleport 1 and `p` to set teleport 2.<br/>
Use `t` to return to teleport 1 and `l` to return to teleport 2.
<br/><br/>

### CoordinateFinder
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/jbsparrow/MiscRobloxExploits/blob/main/CoordinateFinder.lua"))();`<br/><br/>
Shows your coordinates, probably useless to you unless you're working on something that requires coordinates for teleportation. I may add a visibility toggle eventually but for the time being, it's stuck on your screen.
