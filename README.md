# MiscRobloxExploits
Miscellaneous roblox exploits, some that I made and others that are made by other people and improved by me. 

**tpcustom**
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbsparrow/MiscRobloxExploits/main/tpcustom.lua"))();`
Set your own custom teleport points. 
Use `y` to set teleport 1 and `p` to set teleport 2.
Use `t` to return to teleport 1 and `l` to return to teleport 2.

**coordinatefinder**
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbsparrow/MiscRobloxExploits/main/coordinatefinder.lua"))();`
Shows your coordinates in the top left, probably useless to you unless you're working on something that requires coordinates for teleportation. I may add a visibility toggle eventually but for the time being it will stay in the corner unless you leave and rejoin.
